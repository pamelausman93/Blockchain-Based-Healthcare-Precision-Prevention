# Blockchain-Based Healthcare Precision Prevention

A comprehensive blockchain solution for personalized healthcare prevention using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system provides a decentralized platform for healthcare precision prevention, enabling secure and transparent management of health data, risk assessments, prevention protocols, intervention tracking, and outcome measurements.

## Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts:

### 1. Individual Verification Contract (`individual-verification.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Validates health participants and manages verification status
- **Key Features**:
    - Participant verification with health ID assignment
    - Verification level management
    - Owner-controlled verification process
    - Profile management with timestamps

### 2. Risk Prediction Contract (`risk-prediction.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Identifies personalized health risks through data analysis
- **Key Features**:
    - Multi-dimensional risk assessment (cardiovascular, diabetes, cancer)
    - Authorized assessor management
    - Risk score validation and calculation
    - Time-bound risk assessments

### 3. Prevention Protocol Contract (`prevention-protocol.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Develops targeted prevention strategies based on risk profiles
- **Key Features**:
    - Protocol creation and management
    - Risk-based protocol assignment
    - Progress tracking and status updates
    - Duration-based protocol management

### 4. Intervention Tracking Contract (`intervention-tracking.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Monitors prevention interventions and their implementation
- **Key Features**:
    - Intervention lifecycle management
    - Activity logging with compliance scoring
    - Provider assignment and tracking
    - Frequency-based intervention monitoring

### 5. Outcome Measurement Contract (`outcome-measurement.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Evaluates prevention effectiveness and tracks health outcomes
- **Key Features**:
    - Baseline vs. current metrics comparison
    - Improvement score calculation
    - Effectiveness rate tracking
    - Comprehensive outcome reporting

## Data Flow

1. **Verification**: Participants are verified through the Individual Verification Contract
2. **Risk Assessment**: Authorized assessors submit risk predictions
3. **Protocol Assignment**: Prevention protocols are assigned based on risk scores
4. **Intervention Tracking**: Healthcare providers log intervention activities
5. **Outcome Measurement**: Health outcomes are recorded and effectiveness is calculated

## Security Features

- **Owner-only functions**: Critical operations restricted to contract owners
- **Authorization checks**: Multi-level authorization for different user types
- **Data validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Immutable records**: Blockchain-based audit trail

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js for testing

### Deployment

1. Deploy contracts in the following order:
   \`\`\`bash
   clarinet deploy individual-verification
   clarinet deploy risk-prediction
   clarinet deploy prevention-protocol
   clarinet deploy intervention-tracking
   clarinet deploy outcome-measurement
   \`\`\`

2. Initialize contract owners and authorize assessors

### Usage Examples

#### Verify a Participant
```clarity
(contract-call? .individual-verification verify-individual 'SP1234... "HEALTH-ID-001" u1)
